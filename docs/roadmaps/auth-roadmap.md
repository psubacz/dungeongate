# Authentication Service Roadmap

## Overview

The DungeonGate authentication service provides centralized authentication and authorization for the microservices platform. This roadmap outlines the current implementation status and future development priorities.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Core Authentication Features
- **JWT Token Management**: Access and refresh token generation/validation
- **User Login/Logout**: Complete authentication flow with session management
- **Password Management**: Change password and reset password flows
- **Rate Limiting**: Login attempt tracking and account lockout protection
- **gRPC Service**: Full gRPC API implementation with protocol buffers
- **Database Integration**: User data persistence with dual-mode support (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

### ✅ Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage with encryption
- **JWT Security**: Configurable token expiration and secret management
- **Account Lockout**: Brute force protection with configurable thresholds
- **Client Metadata**: IP tracking and user agent logging for security auditing

### ✅ Service Integration
- **Session Service Integration**: gRPC client for authentication requests
- **User Service Integration**: Unified user management across services
- **Health Checks**: Service health monitoring and diagnostics

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Security and Stability (Q1 2025)
**Priority: High**

#### 1.1 Session Management
- [ ] **Session Tracking**: Track active sessions per user
- [ ] **Session Revocation**: Allow users to log out other sessions
- [ ] **Session Expiration**: Configurable session timeout policies

#### 1.2 Security Hardening
- [ ] **Password Policy**: Basic password strength requirements
- [ ] **Failed Login Tracking**: Improve rate limiting and lockout mechanisms
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Authentication event logging for security monitoring

### Phase 2: User Experience (Q2 2025)
**Priority: Medium**

#### 2.1 Password Recovery
- [ ] **Email Integration**: SMTP service for password reset emails
- [ ] **Recovery Link Management**: Secure token generation and expiration
- [ ] **Email Verification**: Validate user email addresses

#### 2.2 Account Management
- [ ] **Profile Updates**: Allow users to update their information
- [ ] **Account Deletion**: User-initiated account removal
- [ ] **Password History**: Prevent password reuse

### Phase 3: Game Integration Features (Q3 2025)
**Priority: Medium**

#### 3.1 Game-Specific Authentication
- [ ] **Game Session Tokens**: Secure tokens for game sessions
- [ ] **Spectator Authentication**: Read-only access for game spectating
- [ ] **Game Access Control**: Per-game access permissions

#### 3.2 Basic Role Management
- [ ] **User Roles**: Basic roles (admin, player, spectator)
- [ ] **Permission Checks**: Role-based access to features
- [ ] **Admin Functions**: User management capabilities

### Phase 4: Performance and Monitoring (Q4 2025)
**Priority: Low**

#### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Token Caching**: In-memory token validation cache
- [ ] **Database Query Optimization**: Improve authentication query performance
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections

#### 4.2 Monitoring
- [ ] **Health Metrics**: Basic service health monitoring
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Authentication timing and success rates
- [ ] **Alert System**: Basic alerts for authentication failures

## Technical Debt and Maintenance

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Achieve 80% test coverage
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Complete API documentation
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses

### Configuration Management
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Support for environment-based config
- [ ] **Secret Rotation**: Basic secret management practices
- [ ] **Configuration Validation**: Startup configuration checks

### Database Management
- [ ] **Migration System**: Proper database migration tooling
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Basic backup procedures
- [ ] **Index Optimization**: Database performance tuning

## Integration Points

### Game Service Integration
- [ ] **Session Validation**: Verify user sessions for game access
- [ ] **Player Identity**: Associate players with game sessions
- [ ] **Access Control**: Game-specific permissions

### Notification Service Integration
- [ ] **Login Alerts**: Optional login notifications
- [ ] **Password Changes**: Notify users of password updates
- [ ] **Security Events**: Alert users to suspicious activity

## Success Metrics

### Security Metrics
- Authentication success rate: >99%
- Failed login attempts blocked: >95%
- Zero security incidents

### Performance Metrics
- Authentication response time: <200ms (95th percentile)
- Service uptime: >99.5%
- Support 1000+ concurrent users

### User Experience Metrics
- Password reset success rate: >90%
- Login success rate: >95%
- Minimal authentication-related support tickets

## Dependencies

### External Services
- SMTP service for email notifications
- Database service (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

### Internal Services
- User service for profile management
- Game service for session management
- Session service for SSH authentication

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security updates and best practices
- **Service Downtime**: Basic redundancy and error recovery
- **Data Loss**: Regular backups and data integrity checks

### Medium Priority Risks
- **Performance Issues**: Load testing and capacity planning
- **Integration Failures**: Comprehensive integration testing

## Conclusion

This streamlined roadmap focuses on delivering a secure, reliable authentication service appropriate for a terminal game hosting platform. The priorities emphasize core security features, basic user management, and game-specific integrations while avoiding enterprise complexity that would be overkill for this use case.
