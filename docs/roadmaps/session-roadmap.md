# Session Service Roadmap - Stateless Architecture

## Overview

The Session Service is a stateless SSH gateway that provides terminal access to games managed by the Game Service. It handles SSH connections, terminal emulation, and real-time streaming while delegating all state management and game logic to the Game Service. This design enables true horizontal scaling and seamless failover.

## Architecture Principles

### Stateless Design
- **No Session Storage**: All session state lives in the Game Service
- **No User State**: User profiles and authentication handled externally
- **No Game State**: Game processes and saves managed by Game Service
- **Pure Transport Layer**: Focus on SSH/PTY/streaming functionality

### Service Responsibilities

#### Session Service (Stateless)
- SSH connection termination
- Terminal (PTY) allocation and management
- Real-time I/O streaming
- Connection pooling and rate limiting
- Spectator broadcasting (real-time only)
- Authentication token validation

#### Game Service (Stateful)
- Session state persistence
- Game process lifecycle management
- Save file management
- Session history and recordings
- Spectator registry and permissions
- Game configuration and paths
